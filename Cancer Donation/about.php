    <section class="container about2">
        <p>The Cancer Care Foundation was established in 2018 and is a charity organisation dedicated to one clear
            purpose – creating the much-needed practical support for cancer patients to ease and improve their treatment
            journey so their energies are focused on getting well.

            Our founders are doctors and cancer treatment specialists. We understand the cancer treatment journey and
            its challenges, and know that a holistic, caring support system makes a real difference for patients and
            their families as they go through their treatment.

            We are local. As part of the CCA Group, our clinics and treatment centres are community focused which means
            we’re aware of the many ways
            in which direct, practical and immediate help is needed – like reliable transport making access to care
            easier, providing a nutritious lunch if it’s a long tiring day, and knowing there’s someone to talk to who
            really understands.</p>
